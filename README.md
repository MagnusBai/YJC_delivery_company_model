# YJC: a quick response and routine solving COMMUNICATION MODEL


## general idea

Imagine your website has to receive some user's request, but solving of his request takes long time.

It is a good choice to reply at once and put request into a TODO-message-queue, in which, every task of the request would be tackled routinely.

I have few experience in WSGI and Web Communication model, so I write this quick and dirty implementation for PokeStar.

## story of YJC

[Yu JianChun](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/17/asia/china-migrant-worker-good-will-hunting/index.html) (余建春) is a Chinese migrant worker serving for a **parcel delivery company**.

He has created an alternative method to verify Carmichael numbers and accept the acceptance from many academic institutions like Zhejiang University.

The reason that I named this spare-time code YJC, lies in his association of **parcel delivery company**.

Most parcel delivery company is also an example of quickly response and routinely solving MODEL.



At last, let's give up some prejudice and enjoy the holliness of the Creator.
